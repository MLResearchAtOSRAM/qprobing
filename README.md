## Quantitative Probing in Python
<!-- Can we infer the quality of a causal analysis by checking how many previously
known causal effects could be correctly recovered by the model? Yes, we can! -->
This is a repository for quantitative probing, which is a method of validating
graphical causal models using quantitative domain knowledge.
It contains two main components:
- The ```qprobing``` package provides methods for a statistical evaluation of the
  effectiveness of different quantitative probing variants.
- The Juypter notebooks ```analysis.ipynb``` and ```connected_analysis.ipynb```,
  together with the ```pkl``` files in this repo, can be used to recreate the
  results of a related research paper. They should also be used as a guide for
  performing your own analyses.


## Installation of the ```qprobing``` package
1. Install ```Python 3.8 or 3.9```. More recent versions should work, too, but the build and
   test pipeline ensures a working state only for these versions. We recommend using a virtual environment for the installation.
2. Install the ```cause2e``` package for causal end-to-end analysis by following
   [these
   instructions](https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/cause2e#installation).
3. Install ```qprobing``` from source by running
   ```
   pip install https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/qprobing/archive/main.tar.gz
   ```
