## Quantitative Probing in Python
Can we validate the quality of a causal analysis (correctly recovered causal
graph and target causal effect) by checking how many previously
known causal effects could be correctly recovered by the model (hit rate)?
Yes, we can!

This is a repository for **quantitative probing**, which is a method of validating
graphical causal models using quantitative domain knowledge.
For more info about the method, check out this
[presentation](https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/qprobing/blob/main/qprobing_cdsm.pdf)
from
[CDSM22](https://www.causalscience.org/meeting/programme/programme-2022/).

The repo contains two main components:
- The ```qprobing``` package provides methods for a statistical evaluation of the
  effectiveness of different quantitative probing variants.
- The Juypter notebooks ```analysis.ipynb``` and ```connected_analysis.ipynb```,
  together with the ```pkl``` files in this repo, can be used to recreate the
  results of a [related research article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03013).
  They should also be used as a guide for performing your own analyses.


## Installation of the ```qprobing``` package
1. Install ```Python 3.8 or 3.9```. More recent versions should work, too, but the build and
   test pipeline ensures a working state only for these versions. We recommend using a virtual environment for the installation.
2. Install the ```cause2e``` package for causal end-to-end analysis by following
   [these
   instructions](https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/cause2e#installation).
3. Install ```qprobing``` from source by running
   ```
   pip install https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/qprobing/archive/main.tar.gz
   ```

If you want to clone the repository into a folder for development on your local machine, please navigate to the folder and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/MLResearchAtOSRAM/qprobing
```
